discusses several objections to his proposed enterprise and his test for
intelligence. Which objections still carry weight? Are his refutations
valid? Can you think of new objections arising from developments since
he wrote the paper? In the paper, he predicts that, by the year 2000, a
computer will have a 30% chance of passing a five-minute Turing Test
with an unskilled interrogator. What chance do you think a computer
would have today? In another 50 years?</p>

            <p><strong>1.7</strong> The neural structure of the sea slug <em>Aplysia</em> has been
widely studied (first by Nobel Laureate Eric Kandel) because it has only
about 20,000 neurons, most of them large and easily manipulated.
Assuming that the cycle time for an <em>Aplysia</em> neuron is
roughly the same as for a human neuron, how does the computational
power, in terms of memory updates per second, compare with the high-end
computer described in :<br /><img src="https://preview.ibb.co/cYrKnn/Screen_Shot_2018_02_28_at_8_21_13_PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018 02 28 at 8 21 13 PM" border="0"  style="width: 100%;" /></p>

            <p><strong>1.11</strong> Many of the computational models of cognitive activities that have been
proposed involve quite complex mathematical operations, such as
convolving an image with a Gaussian or finding a minimum of the entropy
function. Most humans (and certainly all animals) never learn this kind
of mathematics at all, almost no one learns it before college, and
almost no one can compute the convolution of a function with a Gaussian
in their head. What sense does it make to say that the “vision system”
is doing this kind of mathematics, whereas the actual person has no idea
how to do it?</p>

            <p><strong>1.12</strong> Some authors have claimed that perception and motor skills are the most
important part of intelligence, and that “higher level” capacities are
necessarily parasitic—simple add-ons to these underlying facilities.
Certainly, most of evolution and a large part of the brain have been
devoted to perception and motor skills, whereas AI has found tasks such
as game playing and logical inference to be easier, in many ways, than
perceiving and acting in the real world. Do you think that AI’s
traditional focus on higher-level cognitive abilities is misplaced?</p>

            <p><strong>1.20</strong> Various subfields of AI have held contests by defining a standard task
and inviting researchers to do their best. Examples include the DARPA
Grand Challenge for robotic cars, the International Planning
Competition, the Robocup robotic soccer league, the TREC information
retrieval event, and contests in machine translation and speech
recognition. Investigate five of these contests and describe the
progress made over the years. To what degree have the contests advanced
the state of the art in AI? To what degree do they hurt the field by
drawing energy away from new ideas?</p>
